This is a program to solve sudoku puzzles. The user is presented with a grid and enters all of the known values, then hits the "Solve" button. The program then fills in the remaining cells in the grid.

I just put this program together as a fun personal challenge. It is incomplete, as it doesn't work for advanced-level problems. It can only solve relatively basic sudoku scenarios. I will continue working on this to include more complex techniques for deducing cell values. I also plan on extending the program to work on not only 9x9 grids but also 16x16 grids.
